Detail step by step:

Step-1 VPC: A default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to manage networking.
Step-2 Subnets & Availability Zones: Two subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
Step-3 EC2 Instances: Two EC2 instances deployed in separate subnets.


Security Groups:
One SG for EC2 instances, allowing HTTP traffic.
One SG for EFS, permitting access from the EC2 instances.
EFS Storage: A shared file system mounted on both EC2 instances to store website content.


Website Hosting: A web application or static website served from the EC2 instances.

Implementation Steps:
Create a VPC and configure subnets in different availability zones.
Set up two Security Groups:
One for EC2 instances (allowing SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
One for EFS (allowing NFS access from EC2 SG).
Launch two EC2 instances in separate subnets within the VPC.
Create an EFS file system and mount it on both EC2 instances.
Deploy website files on EFS to be accessed by both EC2 instances.
Test website availability from public internet access.

Expected Outcome:
A highly available and scalable website hosted on EC2 instances with shared EFS storage, ensuring redundancy 
and seamless file synchronization across availability zones.
Create 2 SG

1- Web-SG TCP /22/80
2- EFS-SG TCP NFS
